website building exercise for Epicodus, 02.12.2016

By Jacob Steinberg

Description

This is a website I created for my first Java code review. Its main function is to, given a sentence, to remove all the vowels and replace them with hyphens, thus creating a puzzle to solve. This web site is an exercise in HTML, Java and CSS, and is a lesson in spark as well as the velocity template engine.

Program Setup Instructions

navigate to the site, enter in a sentence, click submit, and you will see a puzzle to solve on the next page.
